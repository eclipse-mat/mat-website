	<introduction>
		<html:div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
			<p>The Memory Analyzer has a rich set of features to analyze heap dumps
			from various VM vendors. The available toolset is helpful
			to find the root cause of many memory related problems, e.g. OutOfMemoryErrors.
			The team is currently putting the main focus on <strong>growing the community</strong> 
			around the tool and <strong>looking for new problem domains</strong> where the tool
			could be helpful.</p>
			
			<p>This project plan describes the improvements we target
			for version 1.1.0</p>

					<p>These are some new features that we would like to finish for the 1.1.0 release</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<em>Create single-sourced version of Memory Analyzer(<a
					href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=262603">262603</a>)</em><br />
							Benjamin Muskalla has contributed a set of changes which to enable
							MAT run as a RAP application. The project team will try to integrate 
							all the changes and will aim to provide MAT also as a archive which
							can be deployed in a web server. It is unclear if the team will manage this 
							for the 1.1.0 release.
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>Simplify analysis of dumps with JRuby structures inside(<a
					href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=318989">318989</a>)</em><br />
							A set of MAT extensions aiming to make analysis of heap dumps from
							processes running ruby code (with jruby) easier. The enhancements include
							for example showing	the jruby call-stack for a thread instead the Java call-stack,
							pointing to the script file being executed, etc...

		<theme name="Documentation Improvement">
			<description>
				<html:div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
					<p>The Memory Analyzer documentation is available as (a) help plug-in, (b) WIKI pages
					and (c) blog postings for special topics.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><em>Provide a "developer guide" for extending Memory Analyzer in Wiki</em><br />
							We are working on <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php?title=MemoryAnalyzer/Contributor_Reference#Writing_plugins_for_the_Memory_Analyzer">a set of pages</a>
							describing what the different possibilities to extend MAT are,
							and how such extensions could be written.
						</li>
						<li><em>Review the existing documentation</em><br />
							Currently existing documentation should be reviewed and outdated parts have to 
							be adjusted. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<em>Document new features</em><br />
							The newly developed features have to be properly documented.
						</li>
						<li><em>Publish the Help Plug-in contents on the eclipse.org Page.</em><br />
							Additionally delivering the help content via web pages will make them searchable
							via search engines like Google. This should attract new users to the tool.

				<html:div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
					<p>A vibrant community is essential for the long term health of any project.
					The Memory Analyzer is in a difficult position, because it is a niche tool
					which not only requires some significant domain knowledge about memory analysis
					but also is utilized only sporadically during the development of big applications.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Participate in the Indigo Simultaneous Release.</li>
