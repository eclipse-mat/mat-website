				<li>8 May 2024, Memory Analyzer moved to <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-mat/mat">Github</a>
				<br/>
				The Memory Analyzer code repository has moved from the Eclipse Git servers to Github - <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-mat/mat">https://github.com/eclipse-mat/mat</a>.<br/>
				With this move, the project also switched from using the Eclipse Bugzilla to using Github Issues on the MAT Github project.<br/>
				We are really happy about the move, however, it might take some time to update all places pointing to the old repository at Eclipse. Please bear with us while we do the transition and give us feedback if you see places we've missed to update!
